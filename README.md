# Threat-Detection-and-Monitoring


I referred to online resources to build this home lab to play around and simulate real-world attack scenarios and analyze logs for threat hunting and anomaly detection.

Summary of the lab:
- Using pfSense firewall for Network Segmentation & Security
- Using Security Onion as IDS and log management
- Using Kali Linux as an attacker 
- Using Windows Server 2019 as the domain controller and a Windows 10 machine for attack target
- Using DVWA on Ubuntu as a Vulnerable target machine 
- Collecting logs from Windows machines and Ubuntu to Splunk
- Windows Server and Ubuntu provide a range of targets for both offensive and defensive exercises.
